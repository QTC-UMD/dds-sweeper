## How to flash the firmware

Download the latest [dds-sweeper.uf2 file](https://github.com/QTC-UMD/dds-sweeper/releases/latest/download/dds-sweeper.uf2).
On your Raspberry Pi Pico, hold down the "bootsel" button while plugging the Pico into USB port on a PC (that must already be turned on).
The Pico should mount as a mass storage device (if it doesn't, try again or consult the Pico documentation).
Drag and drop the `.uf2` file into the mounted mass storage device.
The mass storage device should unmount after the copy completes. Your Pico is now running the DDS Sweeper firmware!

## Usage

### Setup

When the DDS Sweeper is started, configuration is required before it can be used. It is often good to begin with a `reset` command, which resets the AD9959.

First, the clock should be setup with the `setclock` command, followed by the `setmult` command.

Second, the number of channels should be configured with the `setchannels` command.

Finally, the mode and timing should be setup with the `mode` command. The DDS Sweeper uses either discrete amplitude, frequency, and phase steps or sweeps of one parameter (possibly with steps of the other parameter) as its primitive instructions. The DDS Sweeper can then use internal timing (in which case it generates triggers internally after each step or sweep) or external timing (in which case it waits for external triggers).

### Program loading

Once setup is complete, instructions (steps or sweeps, depending on the mode) and timings can be loaded using the `set`, `seti`, or `setb` commands. In addition to output instructions, there are special stop and repeat instructions (which can only be loaded using `seti` and `setb`). With instructions are loaded, the address (order in which they are executed) is specified, so the order of loading need not match the order of execution. Timing is set per address, so it is common to all channels. The stop instruction ends program execution, while the repeat instruction restarts program execution from the beginning. Instructions are loaded into an uninitialized array, so skipping instruction addresses or failing to specify stop/repeat at the end of the program may result in undefined behavior.

### Execution

Finally, the program can be executed using the `start` or `hwstart` commands. If termination of the program is required before it reaches a `stop` command, the `abort` command can be used.

## DDS Units

- Output Amplitude is dependent on frequency (some people on Analog Devices forum mentioned amplitude and frequency are related by a sinc function)

- The frequency resolution of the AD9959 is $= \frac{f_{sys clk}}{2^{32}}$. At the default system clock of 500 MHz, the frequency resolution is $\approx 0.1164$ Hz. Frequency input to the DDS Sweeper using the `set` command will be rounded to an integer multiple of the frequency resolution. Frequency input to the DDS Sweeper using the `seti` or `setb` commands will be in units of the frequency resolution.

- The phase resolution of the AD9959 is $= \frac{360^\circ}{2^{14}} \approx 0.02197^\circ$. Phase offsets given using the `set` command will be rounded to a multiple of this resolution. Phase offets given using the `seti` or `setb` commands will be in units of this resolution.

- The amplitude resolution of the AD9959 is $= \frac{1}{2^{10}} \approx 0.09767\%$. Amplitude scale factors given using the `set` command will be rounded to a multiple of this resolution. Amplitude scale factors given using the `seti` or `setb` commands will be in units of this resolution.

## Sweeps

- Setting up a sweep:  
![Sweep Setup Figure](img/sweep-setup.png)  
Sweeps are defined by two parameters, sweep delta and ramp rate.
- Sweep Delta defines the change in output amplitude/frequency/phase on each sweep step
- Ramp rate defines how often a sweep step is taken. It is based off of the AD9959's sync clock signal which will be one quarter of the AD9959's system clock. The ramp rate parameter specifies the number of sync clock cycles per sweep step. A ramp rate of 1 will cause the sweep delta to be applied every 1 sync clock cycle. For upward sweeps, the ramp rate parameter can have a value of 1-255. For downward sweeps the ramp rate can only be 1.

## Serial API

Note: Commands must be terminated with `\n`.

### Status commands

- `version`:  
Responds with a string containing the firmware version.

- `status`:  
Returns the opperating status of the DDS-Sweeper. `0` status indicates manual mode. `1` status indicates buffered execution. `2` status indicates aborting buffered execution.

- `clkstatus`:
Returns the clocking status of the DDS-Sweeper as three numbers: `<int:mode> <double:freq> <int:mult>`.
Mode can be `0` for internal clocking or `1` for external clocking of the AD9959.
The frequency is the AD9959 reference frequency, in Hz.
`mult` is the AD9959 PLL multiplier. The corresponding system frequency is `freq*mult`.

- `getfreqs`:  
Responds with a multi-line string containing the current operating frequencies of various clocks (you will be most interested in `pll_sys` and `clk_sys`). Multiline string ends with `ok\n`.

### State commands

- `start`:  
Starts buffered execution immediately.

- `hwstart`:  
Starts buffered execution once an external trigger is received.

- `abort`:  
Stops buffered execution immediately.

### Setup commands

- `setclock <mode:int> <freq:int> (<pll_mult:int>)`:  
Reconfigures the source/reference clock.
  - Mode `0`: Use pico system clock as reference to the AD9959.
    In this mode, the frequency provided also sets the pico system clock
    and it cannot exceed 133 MHz.
    The dds sweeper defaults to this mode with a frequency of 125 MHz and a PLL multiplier of 4.
  - Mode `1`: Sets the AD9959 to recieve a reference clock not from the pico.
    Setting this mode does not change the pico system clock.

  `pll_mult` is an optional input that sets the AD9959's PLL multiplier on the Reference Clock input. The default value is 4, giving the AD9959 a system clock of 500 MHz with the pico's 125 MHz reference. Valid values are 1 or 4-20.  
  The AD9959's PLL has an output range of 100-160 MHz or 255-500 MHz with VCO gain enabled. The pico will automatically enable the VCO gain bit if the requested frequency is in the upper range. If trying to use the PLL multiplier to generate a frequency between 160 and 255 MHz, there is no guarantee of operation.

- `setchannels <num:int>`:  
Sets how many channels being used by the table mode. Uses the lowest channels first, starting with channel 0. If number of channels is set to `0`, buffered execution instructions will be written to all 4 channels simultaneously.

- `mode <sweep-type:int> <trigger-source:int>`:  
Configures what mode the DDS-Sweeper is operating in
  - 0: single stepping / manual mode
  - 1: amplitude sweep
  - 2: frequency sweep
  - 3: phase sweep
  - 4: amplitude sweep with frequency/phase steps
  - 5: frequency sweep with amplitude/phase steps
  - 6: phase sweep with frequency/amplitude steps  

  The operating mode must be set before buffered execution instructions can be programmed into the DDS-Sweeper.  
  A `trigger-source` of `0` means the Sweeper is expecting external triggers. A `trigger-source` of `1` means the Sweeper will send its own triggers and `set` commands will require an aditional `time` argument.

### Manual output commands

- `setfreq <channel:int> <frequency:float>`:  
Manually set the output frequency of a specified channel. Channels are 0-3 and frequencies are in Hz. If `debug` is set to on, it will respond with the actual frequency set. The Sweeper must be in manual mode.

- `setphase <channel:int> <phase_offset:float>`:  
Manually set the phase offset of a specified channel. Channels are 0-3 and offsets are in degrees. If `debug` is set to on, it will respond with the actual degree offset set. The Sweeper must be in manual mode.

- `setamp <channel:int> <amplituce_scale_factor:float>`:  
Manually set the amplitude scale factor of a specified channel. Channels are 0-3 and amplitude scale factors are a precentage of the maximum output voltage. If `debug` is set to on, it will respond with the actual frequency set. The Sweeper must be in manual mode.

### Data loading commands

- `set`:  
Sets the value of instruction number `addr` for channel `channel` (zero indexed). `addr` starts at 0. It looks different depending on what mode the sweeper is in. If `Debug` is set to `on` it will respond with the actual values set for that instruction.
  - Single Stepping (mode 0): `set <channel:int> <addr:int> <frequency:float> <amplitude:float> <phase:float> (<time:int>)`
  - Sweep Mode (modes 1-3): `set <channel:int> <addr:int> <start_point:float> <end_point:float> <delta:float> (<time:int>)`

    `start_point` is the value the sweep should start from, and `end_point` is where it will stop. `delta` is the amount that the output should change by every cycle of the sweep clock. In the AD9959, the sweep clock runs at one quarter the system clock. The types of values expected for `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` different depending on the type of sweep  
    - Amplitude Sweeps (mode 1)  
        `start_point` and `end_point` should be decimals between 0 and 1 that represent the desired proprtion of the maximum output amplitude. `delta` is the desired change in that proprtion. For all three of those values there is a resolution of $\frac{1}{1024} \approx 0.09766\$
    - Frequency Sweeps (mode 2)  
        `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` are frequencies in Hz. They can have decimal values, but they will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the frequency resolution.
    - Phase Sweeps (mode 3)
        `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` are in degrees. They can have decimal values, but they will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the phase resolution (always $= 360^\circ / 2^{14} \approx 0.02197^\circ$).

  - Sweep and Single Stepping Mode (modes 4-6): `set <channel:int> <addr:int> <start_point:float> <end_point:float> <delta:float> <secondary1:double> <secondary2:double> (<time:int>)`

    These modes perform a linear sweep on one of the parameters, while simultaneously single stepping on the other two parameters.
    - Amplitude Sweeps (mode 4)  
        `secondary1` is the frequency, and `secondary2` is the phase offset.
    - Frequency Sweeps (mode 5)  
        `secondary1` is the amplitude scale factor, and `secondary2` is the phase offset.
    - Phase Sweeps (mode 6)  
        `secondary1` is the frequency, and `secondary2` is the amplitude scale factor.

- `seti`:  
Sets the value of instruction number `addr` for channel `channel` (zero indexed). `addr` starts at 0. It looks different depending on what mode the sweeper is in. If `Debug` is set to `on` it will respond with the actual values set for that instruction. `seti` uses integer values (AD9959 units) rather than floating point values. Otherwise, it is the same as `set`.
  - Single Stepping (mode 0): `seti <channel:int> <addr:int> <frequency:int> <amplitude:int> <phase:int> (<time:int>)`
  - Sweep Mode (modes 1-3): `seti <channel:int> <addr:int> <start_point:int> <end_point:int> <delta:int> <ramp-rate:int> (<time:int>)`

    `start_point` is the value the sweep should start from, and `end_point` is where it will stop. `delta` is the amount that the output should change by every cycle of the sweep clock. In the AD9959, the sweep clock runs at one quarter the system clock. `ramp-rate` is an additional divider that can applied to slow down the sweep clock further, must be in the range 1-255. The types of values expected for `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` different depending on the type of sweep  
    - Amplitude Sweeps (mode 1)  
        `start_point` and `end_point` should be integers between 0 and 1023 (inclusive).
    - Frequency Sweeps (mode 2)  
        `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` are integers between 0 and $2^{32} - 1$ in units of system clock rate (typically $500$ MHz) over $2^{32}$.
    - Phase Sweeps (mode 3)
        `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` are between 0 and 65535 (inclusive).

  - Sweep and Single Stepping Mode (modes 4-6): `set <channel:int> <addr:int> <start_point:int> <end_point:int> <delta:int> <ramp-rate:int> <secondary1:int> <secondary2:int> (<time:int>)`

    These modes perform a linear sweep on one of the parameters, while simultaneously single stepping on the other two parameters.
    - Amplitude Sweeps (mode 4)  
        `secondary1` is the frequency, and `secondary2` is the phase offset.
    - Frequency Sweeps (mode 5)  
        `secondary1` is the amplitude scale factor, and `secondary2` is the phase offset.
    - Phase Sweeps (mode 6)  
        `secondary1` is the frequency, and `secondary2` is the amplitude scale factor.

- `setb <start address:int> <instruction count:int>`:  
Bulk setting of instructions in binary. `start address` is the address of the first instruction loaded. `instruction count` instructions will be programmed. If there is not sufficient space for that many instructions, the response will be an error message. Otherwise, the response will be `ready for <byte count:int> bytes`, where `byte count` is the number of bytes the device is expecting. An array of instructions can then be transmitted. Note that all active channels are loaded together. The layout of the instruction array is mode dependent, and in the table below each mode is assumed to use external timing (with internal timing is in parentheses, in this case, append `, ('time', '<u4')` to the end of the np.dtype list)

| Mode  | Bytes per channel per instruction  | np.dtype  |
|---| :---: |:---:|
| Single Stepping (mode 0)  | 8 (12) | `[('frequency', '<u4'), ('amplitude', '<u2'), ('phase', '<u2')]`  |
| Amplitude Sweeps (mode 1)  | 7 (11) |  `[('start_amplitude', '<u2'), ('stop_amplitude', '<u2'), ('delta', '<u2'), ('rate', '<u1')]` |
| Frequency Sweeps (mode 2) | 13 (17) |  `[('start_frequency', '<u4'), ('stop_frequency', '<u4'), ('delta', '<u4'), ('rate', '<u1')]` |
| Phase Sweeps (mode 3)  | 7 (11) | `[('start_phase', '<u2'), ('stop_phase', '<u2'), ('delta', '<u2'), ('rate', '<u1')]` |
| Amplitude Sweep and Single Stepping (mode 4) | 13 (17)  | `[('start_amplitude', '<u2'), ('stop_amplitude', '<u2'), ('delta', '<u2'), ('rate', '<u1'), ('frequency', '<u4'), ('phase', '<u2')]`  |
| Frequency Sweep and Single Stepping (mode 5) | 17 (21) | `[('start_frequency', '<u4'), ('stop_frequency', '<u4'), ('delta', '<u4'), ('rate', '<u1'), ('amplitude', '<u2'), ('phase', '<u2')]`  |
| Phase Sweep and Single Stepping (mode 6)  | 13 (17) | `[('start_phase', '<u2'), ('stop_phase', '<u2'), ('delta', '<u2'), ('rate', '<u1'), ('frequency', '<u4'), ('amplitude', '<u2')]`  |

### Flash commands

- `save`:  
Saves the buffered execution table to nonvolatile memory so that it can be recovered later (after a power cycle).

- `load`:  
Retrieves the buffered execution table stored in nonvolatile memory and restores it to system memory so that it can be run. A saved table must be loaded before it can be run.

### Debugging commands

- `debug <state:str>`:  
Turns on extra debug messages printed over serial. `state` should be `on` or `off` (no string quotes required).

- `numtriggers`:  
Responds with the nmumber of triggers processed since the last call of `start`

- `program`:  
Reboots the Pi Pico into firmware flashing mode. Serial will immediately disconnect and a mass storage device should appear.

## Compiling the firmware

If you want to make changes to the firmware, or want to compile it yourself (because you don't trust binary blobs from the internet), we provide a docker configuration to help you do that.

1. Install docker desktop and make sure it is running (if you are on Windows, you may have to mess around a bit to get virtualisation working at an operating system level)
2. Clone this repository
3. Open a terminal with the current working directory set to the repository root (the `docker-compose.yaml`` file should be there)
4. Run `docker compose build --pull` to build the docker container
5. Run `docker compose up` to build the PrawnBlaster firmware.

Step 4 will take a while as it has to build the docker container.
If it is slow to download packages from the Ubuntu package repositories, consider providing an explicit apt mirror that is fast for you: `docker compose build --pull --build-arg APT_MIRROR="http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/"`.

If you want to change which version of the pico SDK it builds against, this is set in the `build/docker/Dockerfile` file.
Just change the git tag of the pico SDK that gets cloned out by git, then rebuild the docker container (see step 4).

Note once the docker container is built, you can run step 5 as many times as you like.
You do not need to rebuild the container, even if you make changes to the PrawnBlaster source code.
You only need to rebuild the docker container if you modify the `build/docker/Dockerfile` file.

Responds with a multi-line string containing the current operating frequencies of various clocks (you will be most interested in `pll_sys` and `clk_sys`). Multiline string ends with `ok\n`.

### State commands

* `start`:  
Starts buffered execution immediately.

* `hwstart`:  
Starts buffered execution once an external trigger is received.

* `abort`:  
Stops buffered execution immediately.

### Setup commands

* `setclock <mode:int> <freq:int> (<pll_mult:int>)`:  
Reconfigures the source/reference clock.
  - Mode `0`: Use pico system clock as reference to the AD9959.
    In this mode, the frequency provided also sets the pico system clock
    and it cannot exceed 133 MHz.
    The dds sweeper defaults to this mode with a frequency of 125 MHz and a PLL multiplier of 4.
  - Mode `1`: Sets the AD9959 to recieve a reference clock not from the pico.
    Setting this mode does not change the pico system clock.

  `pll_mult` is an optional input that sets the AD9959's PLL multiplier on the Reference Clock input. The default value is 4, giving the AD9959 a system clock of 500 MHz with the pico's 125 MHz reference. Valid values are 1 or 4-20.  
  The AD9959's PLL has an output range of 100-160 MHz or 255-500 MHz with VCO gain enabled. The pico will automatically enable the VCO gain bit if the requested frequency is in the upper range. If trying to use the PLL multiplier to generate a frequency between 160 and 255 MHz, there is no guarantee of operation.

* `setchannels <num:int>`:  
Sets how many channels being used by the table mode. Uses the lowest channels first, starting with channel 0. If number of channels is set to `0`, buffered execution instructions will be written to all 4 channels simultaneously.

* `mode <sweep-type:int> <trigger-source:int>`:  
Configures what mode the DDS-Sweeper is operating in
  - 0: single stepping / manual mode
  - 1: amplitude sweep
  - 2: frequency sweep
  - 3: phase sweep
  - 4: amplitude sweep with frequency/phase steps
  - 5: frequency sweep with amplitude/phase steps
  - 6: phase sweep with frequency/amplitude steps  

  The operating mode must be set before buffered execution instructions can be programmed into the DDS-Sweeper.  
  A `trigger-source` of `0` means the Sweeper is expecting external triggers. A `trigger-source` of `1` means the Sweeper will send its own triggers and `set` commands will require an aditional `time` argument.

### Manual output commands


* `setfreq <channel:int> <frequency:float>`:  
Manually set the output frequency of a specified channel. Channels are 0-3 and frequencies are in Hz. If `debug` is set to on, it will respond with the actual frequency set. The Sweeper must be in manual mode.


* `setphase <channel:int> <phase_offset:float>`:  
Manually set the phase offset of a specified channel. Channels are 0-3 and offsets are in degrees. If `debug` is set to on, it will respond with the actual degree offset set. The Sweeper must be in manual mode.


* `setamp <channel:int> <amplituce_scale_factor:float>`:  
Manually set the amplitude scale factor of a specified channel. Channels are 0-3 and amplitude scale factors are a precentage of the maximum output voltage. If `debug` is set to on, it will respond with the actual frequency set. The Sweeper must be in manual mode.


### Data loading commands

* `set`:  
Sets the value of instruction number `addr` for channel `channel` (zero indexed). `addr` starts at 0. It looks different depending on what mode the sweeper is in. If `Debug` is set to `on` it will respond with the actual values set for that instruction.
  - Single Stepping (mode 0): `set <channel:int> <addr:int> <frequency:float> <amplitude:float> <phase:float> (<time:int>)`
  - Sweep Mode (modes 1-3): `set <channel:int> <addr:int> <start_point:float> <end_point:float> <delta:float> (<time:int>)`

    `start_point` is the value the sweep should start from, and `end_point` is where it will stop. `delta` is the amount that the output should change by every cycle of the sweep clock. In the AD9959, the sweep clock runs at one quarter the system clock. The types of values expected for `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` different depending on the type of sweep  
      - Amplitude Sweeps (mode 1)  
        `start_point` and `end_point` should be decimals between 0 and 1 that represent the desired proprtion of the maximum output amplitude. `delta` is the desired change in that proprtion. For all three of those values there is a resolution of $\frac{1}{1024} \approx 0.09766\$
      - Frequency Sweeps (mode 2)  
        `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` are frequencies in Hz. They can have decimal values, but they will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the frequency resolution.
      - Phase Sweeps (mode 3)
        `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` are in degrees. They can have decimal values, but they will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the phase resolution (always $= 360^\circ / 2^{14} \approx 0.02197^\circ$). 

  - Sweep and Single Stepping Mode (modes 4-6): `set <channel:int> <addr:int> <start_point:float> <end_point:float> <delta:float> <secondary1:double> <secondary2:double> (<time:int>)`

    These modes perform a linear sweep on one of the parameters, while simulaneously single stepping on the other two parameters.
      - Amplitude Sweeps (mode 4)  
        `secondary1` is the frequency, and `secondary2` is the phase offset.
      - Frequency Sweeps (mode 5)  
        `secondary1` is the amplitude scale factor, and `secondary2` is the phase offset.
      - Phase Sweeps (mode 6)  
        `secondary1` is the frequency, and `secondary2` is the amplitude scale factor.


* `seti`:  
Sets the value of instruction number `addr` for channel `channel` (zero indexed). `addr` starts at 0. It looks different depending on what mode the sweeper is in. If `Debug` is set to `on` it will respond with the actual values set for that instruction. `seti` uses integer values (AD9959 units) rather than floating point values. Otherwise, it is the same as `set`.
  - Single Stepping (mode 0): `seti <channel:int> <addr:int> <frequency:int> <amplitude:int> <phase:int> (<time:int>)`
  - Sweep Mode (modes 1-3): `seti <channel:int> <addr:int> <start_point:int> <end_point:int> <delta:int> <ramp-rate:int> (<time:int>)`

    `start_point` is the value the sweep should start from, and `end_point` is where it will stop. `delta` is the amount that the output should change by every cycle of the sweep clock. In the AD9959, the sweep clock runs at one quarter the system clock. `ramp-rate` is an additional divider that can applied to slow down the sweep clock further, must be in the range 1-255. The types of values expected for `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` different depending on the type of sweep  
      - Amplitude Sweeps (mode 1)  
        `start_point` and `end_point` should be integers between 0 and 1023 (inclusive).
      - Frequency Sweeps (mode 2)  
        `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` are integers between 0 and $2^{32} - 1$ in units of system clock rate (typically $500$ MHz) over $2^{32}$.
      - Phase Sweeps (mode 3)
        `start_point`, `end_point`, and `delta` are between 0 and 65535 (inclusive).

  - Sweep and Single Stepping Mode (modes 4-6): `set <channel:int> <addr:int> <start_point:int> <end_point:int> <delta:int> <ramp-rate:int> <secondary1:int> <secondary2:int> (<time:int>)`

    These modes perform a linear sweep on one of the parameters, while simulaneously single stepping on the other two parameters.
      - Amplitude Sweeps (mode 4)  
        `secondary1` is the frequency, and `secondary2` is the phase offset.
      - Frequency Sweeps (mode 5)  
        `secondary1` is the amplitude scale factor, and `secondary2` is the phase offset.
      - Phase Sweeps (mode 6)  
        `secondary1` is the frequency, and `secondary2` is the amplitude scale factor.

* `setb <start address:int> <instruction count:int>`:  
Bulk setting of instructions in binary. `start address` is the address of the first instruction loaded. `instruction count` instructions will be programmed. If there is not sufficient space for that many instructions, the response will be an error message. Otherwise, the response will be `ready for <byte count:int> bytes`, where `byte count` is the number of bytes the device is expecting. An array of instructions can then be transmitted. Note that all active channels are loaded together. The layout of the instruction array is mode dependent, and in the table below each mode is assumed to use external timing (where internal timing bytes are in parentheses and the dtype list must have `, ('time', '<u4')` appended)

| Mode  | Bytes per channel per instruction  | np.dtype  |
|---| :---: |:---:|
| Single Stepping (mode 0)  | 8 (12) | `[('frequency', '<u4'), ('amplitude', '<u2'), ('phase', '<u2')]`  |
| Amplitude Sweeps (mode 1)  | 7 (11) |  `[('start_amplitude', '<u2'), ('stop_amplitude', '<u2'), ('delta', '<u2'), ('rate', '<u1')]` |
| Frequency Sweeps (mode 2) | 13 (17) |  `[('start_frequency', '<u4'), ('stop_frequency', '<u4'), ('delta', '<u4'), ('rate', '<u1')]` |
| Phase Sweeps (mode 3)  | 7 (11) | `[('start_phase', '<u2'), ('stop_phase', '<u2'), ('delta', '<u2'), ('rate', '<u1')]` |
| Amplitude Sweep and Single Stepping (mode 4) | 13 (17)  | `[('start_amplitude', '<u2'), ('stop_amplitude', '<u2'), ('delta', '<u2'), ('rate', '<u1'), ('frequency', '<u4'), ('phase', '<u2')]`  |
| Frequency Sweep and Single Stepping (mode 5) | 17 (21) | `[('start_frequency', '<u4'), ('stop_frequency', '<u4'), ('delta', '<u4'), ('rate', '<u1'), ('amplitude', '<u2'), ('phase', '<u2')]`  |
| Phase Sweep and Single Stepping (mode 6)  | 13 (17) | `[('start_phase', '<u2'), ('stop_phase', '<u2'), ('delta', '<u2'), ('rate', '<u1'), ('frequency', '<u4'), ('amplitude', '<u2')]`  |

### Flash commands

* `save`:  
Saves the buffered execution table to nonvolatile memory so that it can be recovered later (after a power cycle). 

* `load`:  
Retrieves the buffered execution table stored in nonvolatile memory and restores it to system memory so that it can be run. A saved table must be loaded before it can be run.

### Debugging commands

* `debug <state:str>`:  
Turns on extra debug messages printed over serial. `state` should be `on` or `off` (no string quotes required).

* `numtriggers`:  
Responds with the number of triggers processed since the last call of `start`

* `program`:  
Reboots the Pi Pico into firmware flashing mode. Serial will immediately disconnect and a mass storage device should appear.

## Compiling the firmware

If you want to make changes to the firmware, or want to compile it yourself (because you don't trust binary blobs from the internet), we provide a docker configuration to help you do that.

1. Install docker desktop and make sure it is running (if you are on Windows, you may have to mess around a bit to get virtualisation working at an operating system level)
2. Clone this repository
3. Open a terminal with the current working directory set to the repository root (the `docker-compose.yaml`` file should be there)
4. Run `docker compose build --pull` to build the docker container
5. Run `docker compose up` to build the PrawnBlaster firmware.

Step 4 will take a while as it has to build the docker container.
If it is slow to download packages from the Ubuntu package repositories, consider providing an explicit apt mirror that is fast for you: `docker compose build --pull --build-arg APT_MIRROR="http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/"`.

If you want to change which version of the pico SDK it builds against, this is set in the `build/docker/Dockerfile` file.
Just change the git tag of the pico SDK that gets cloned out by git, then rebuild the docker container (see step 4).

Note once the docker container is built, you can run step 5 as many times as you like.
You do not need to rebuild the container, even if you make changes to the PrawnBlaster source code.
You only need to rebuild the docker container if you modify the `build/docker/Dockerfile` file.
